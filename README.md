# Indie Game Dev Beginners Game Jam, Sept 2023
Theme: Limited Space
Coded in ~5 days using Raylib in C++

# Core Gameplay Loop
Explore a shrinking room to discover stairs that go deeper and deeper into the dungeon.
Slash enemies to engage in combat with them, where you must slash in a direction (downwards, left, and right) other than the direction the enemy is blocking.
Every kill grows the border for you to explore more, but getting hit shrinks the border faster and subtracts a life (3 lives that replenish every stage). If you touch the edge, your run is over.
Go as deep as you can until you truly start to witness your diminishing returns.
Don't forget to avoid projectiles too, or just cut them down if they get in your way.
